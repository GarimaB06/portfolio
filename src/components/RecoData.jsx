			"I've recently had the pleasure of working directly with Garima on an open source product, called Docketeer. We worked together to remodel the primary metrics display to deliver a dashboard that added an intuitive feel to the GUI we were building. From this peer programming, I've witnessed her creative vision and her ability to identify and to communicate potential roadblocks and their solutions. She has a passion for developing incredible UI/UX and it clearly shows in her flexible and robust front end code. I cannot recommend her enough as she will be a great asset to any team.",
